	    <p><i>Chrono Trigger</i> is an iconic and foundational JRPG that has stood the test of time. I was fortunate enough to get a loose copy of the DS remaster at a Play and Trade in Huntington, NY back in 2016 or so, giving me the opportunity to play and appreciate it. This game is very much a classic JRPG, but in a way it helped to define the genre in the first place. Featuring art from the late, great Akira Toriyama, a brilliant soundtrack, and a story oozing with character and creativity, <i>Chrono Trigger</i> impresses in most ways. The DS remaster offers some new animated cutscenes, which act as a nice reward throughout the playthrough, indicating major story milestones. Unfortunately, the combat - of which there is plenty - is quite simple and easy to solve. Ultimately, <i>Chrono Trigger</i> is a classic, and well deserving of it's reputation.<br><br>
