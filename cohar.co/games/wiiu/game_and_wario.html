	    <p>Every so often comes a game that shatters expectations, and redefines a whole console generation. <i>Game &amp; Wario</i> is NOT such a game. Like the <i>WarioWare</i> titles, this game acts as a tech demo showcasing the "many" uses for the Wii U GamePad. Ultimately, I feel like that is what sets this game back - the GamePad. There are only 12 single player minigames this time around, and an additional 4 multiplayer; the Miiverse functionality is offline, so I couldn't try it. Even with such a small selection of minigames, it is clear that they are running out of ways to creatively use the GamePad. That being said, there are a few games that challenge you to use both screens interchangeably, which I found to be a lot of fun - Gamer, Bird, Design, and bowling were some of my favorites. The minigames are weird (like always), but a few are <i>very</i> weird. I have to highlight the Ski minigame, which features a glorious 3D model of Jimmy T. There are ample collectables but otherwise little replayability, despite the larger minigames. <br><br>
