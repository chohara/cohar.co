        <p>Star Fox Zero was Shigeru Miyamoto's attempt at saving the Wii U by leveraging it's unique hardware. What resulted is a nauseating adventure with just enough charm to make the ride worth it. In order to succeed in Star Fox Zero, you need to use the GamePad screen and the display screen at the same time. This makes it an awkward challenge, although it is quite rewarding when you do improve with the fried mechanics. The collectibles are frustrating, confusing, and don't entice me into collecting more, even as a lover of collectathons. Through this, Star Fox Zero has some fun and quirky characters that make the journey memorable. <br><br>
