	    <p>My only exposure to the <i>Paper Mario</i> came through <i>Thousand Year Door</i> during childhood - a game which I never finished. <i>Color Splash</i> must not have ingtrigued me on release, as I didn't give it a chance. As I've recently been returning to the Wii U catalog, I was excited to revisit this entry in the series, considering that it's exclusive to the console. All that said, <i>Color Splash</i> is a solid JRPG experience, with fun moments and some slight headaches. The core mechanic of the game - painting with your hammer - is great fun, and somehow never got old. What did get old were the esoteric "Thing" cards, and their abstract uses. Thankfully, the headaches that <i>Color Splash</i> presents are easily remedied and don't detract all that much from the experience - at least in my opinion. <br><br>
	Play it for the:

	    <li>Fun painting mechanic</li>
	    <li>Humorous dialogue</li>
	    <li>Creative and charming levels and sub-plots</li>
	</ul>
