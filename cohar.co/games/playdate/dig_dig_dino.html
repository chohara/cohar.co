        <p>Indika is a walking simulator with brief puzzle and platforming sections. With that, gameplay is naturally limited, and the focus is instead on narrative, and other storytelling elements. You play as Indika, a Russian nun who departs her convent in order to deliver a letter. Without giving too much away, the story is quite compelling, and the game does a good job of mixing up gameplay, so that it doesn't get too repetitive.<br><br>
