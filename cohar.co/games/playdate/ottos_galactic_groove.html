	    <p><i>Otto's Galactic Groove!!</i> is a part of Playdate's <i>Season 2</i>, and plays as a classic rhythm game while making use of the crank. The story is simple - you are a doodly creature named </i>Otto</i> who is tasked with sampling music from across the galaxy. To play, you use the crank to position a slider, and try to time a button press with a passing "note". It is very simple, and the central usage of the crank makes for a great amount of fun. The music is quite solid for the Playdate, and features a range of genres. There is also a good deal of replayability, with the track editor and online community features.<br><br>
