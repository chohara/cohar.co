	    <p><i>The Scrolling Engima</i> is a very quick play that symbolizes game development. I picked this up on a whim shortly after getting a Playdate device for my birthday this year. The game features a handful of puzzles that take advantage of the Playdate's features such as crank and microphone. The puzzles range in quality, with the final puzzle being quite esoteric. I couldn't earnestly recommend this game, but it worked as a nice tech demo for the device. Playing this inspires me to try making a Playdate game myself.<br><br>
