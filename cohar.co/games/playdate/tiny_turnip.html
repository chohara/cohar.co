        <p><i>Tiny Turnip</i> is a metroidvania that demonstrates what the Playdate can do when developers fully embrace its unique hardware. The crank isn't just a gimmick here - it's woven into the core gameplay in ways that feel natural and inventive, navigating through tight platforming sections or solving a puzzle with your abilities. Each zone offers its own distinct aesthetic and challenges, keeping the exploration fresh as you uncover new abilities and pathways. The soundtrack deserves special mention, with spacey, atmospheric tracks that enhance the sense of discovery and isolation. While the monochrome display is a limitation, the game works within those constraints admirably, though the map system can be a bit finicky to parse at times. Still, it does enough to keep you oriented as you traverse the interconnected world. <i>Tiny Turnip</i> is a testament to rock-solid design principles applied thoughtfully to unconventional hardware.<br><br>
