	    <p>The <i>Wii</i> always was a quirky system with a well-defined identity. Certain genres of game have always flourished on the console due to the centralizing motion control scheme. In particular the <i>Wii</i> has always been a haven for rail-shooters, one of which - </i>Gunslingers</i> - I recently had the pleasure of finding in a GameStop retro section. Information about this game is sparce, but there are a few gameplay videos. The story is simple, you chase an evil professor and his evil train before it blows something up. There are a few characters to choose from, but they don't seem to impact the game mechanically. The rail-shooting is okay, with indvidual levels varying in quality. There are some slight graphical glitches, but overall the shooting is fair and responsive. The story mode is very short, but there are some additional modes that supplement the gameplay. For what seemed to be lost-software, <i>Gunslingers</i> is acceptable, although nothing to go out of your way for unless you're a rail-shooter fanatic. <br><br>
