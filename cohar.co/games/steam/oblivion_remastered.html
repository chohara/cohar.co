	    <p>The release of <i>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</i> last week came as a complete surprise - with a launch that immediately followed it's announcement. At first I wasn't too excited to play it, but the trailers looked good, and I have some undeniable nostalgia for <i>Oblivion</i>. So, I caved, and I bought a Bethesda game on release day. After bypassing some funky display issues on launch, I found it to be a pretty smooth experience - shockingly! <i>Oblivion Remastered</i> is a fantastic remaster, and a good example of what a remaster should be, in my opinion. It keeps all of the quirk and style of the original, while adding some quality of life changes that only add to the experience or remove headache. I found myself entranced with exploring a familiar, yet facelifted world. <i>Oblivion</i> does a lot of things well, and represents a happy medium between the more hardcore fantasy RPG gameplay of <i>Morrowind</i>, and the softcore gameplay of <i>Skyrim</i>. As of right now, I would call this the definitive experience of <i>The Elder Scrolls</i> series. Fans new and old should do themselves a favor and give this classic a try.<br><br>
	Play it for the:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Definitive <i>The Elder Scrolls</i> experience</li>
	    <li>Distinct style, voice acting, and setting</li>
	    <li>Fun and addicting questlines</li>
	</ul>
