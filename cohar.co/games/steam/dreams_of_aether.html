	    <p><i>Dreams of Aether</i> is the latest game in the <i>Aether Universe</i>, and was available for free for a brief duration at launch. The game is meant to be analogous to <i>WarioWare</i> - and it does a rather decent job at emulating the style. I found the characters to be quirky and well designed, and the sound design to be enjoyable. The minigames are very simple, and designed for a controller layout - perfect for the Steam Deck. While the simplicity makes for an easy platinum/completion, it leaves one wanting a bit more depth and challenge. Presentation is quite solid for a <i>Rivals of Aether</i> spinoff game! I'm enticed me to try <i>Lovers of Aether</i>...<br><br>
