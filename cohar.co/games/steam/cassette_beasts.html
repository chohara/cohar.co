	    <p><i>Cassette Beasts</i> is a good example of what I've enjoyed about having regular gaming discussion group - it's something that I <i>never</i> would have played were it not chosen by the group. The reason being that it is a <i>Pokemon</i> clone. I used to enjoy <i>Pokemon</i> a lot, but I think that I got my fix early on and haven't had much of a desire to revisit it. All that considered, <i>Cassette Beasts</i> does a good job emulating the <i>Pokemon</i> experience, while adding some unique features. There are some new types, and existing types have been reworked with some added complexity. Encounters aren't random which is a nice change, and exploration is fun, but unrewarding. A big highlight is the soundtrack, featuring some songs which contain lyrics! The story is okay, but nothing memorable. I found progression to be smooth which made it pleasant to finish. I won't be giving this game too much more time, but I'm glad to have played it - I would easily recommend it to a fan of the <i>Pokemon</i> formula.<br><br>
