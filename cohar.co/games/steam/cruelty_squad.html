	    <p>On it's surface, <i>Cruelty Squad</i> is a first-person shooter, wrapped in a mess of high contrast textures and visual bloat. While this remains the case throughout the experience, the game finds some success as a sandbox immersive sim. Certain levels succeed in some aspects, but fail in others - and then in the next level the reverse may be true. The balance feels off, and some weapons and equipment are vastly outperforming others. Where the fun lies is in the creative and hacky solutions that the game encourages. At times it feels like an immersive sim set in <i>Garry's Mod</i>, or some twisted demake - in a good way. The experience is ultimately hampered by the amateur presentation and polish. The models, menus, enemy pathing, level design, etc. are all lacking in ways that are hard to overlook in the current landscape of game development.<br><br>
