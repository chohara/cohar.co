	    <p>I have always had a tough time engaging with very long form narrative based media. The longer the commitment, the lower the likelihood I would complete it - especially with so many games competing for attention. Recently I pushed myself to play through <i>Persona 3 Reload</i>, in order to broaden my gaming perspective. While my personal preference has not changed, I can say that this entry in the lauded <i>Persona</i> series was a worthwhile play. The game follows a group of high school students who become involved with some otherworldly circumstances. The gameplay loop is quite simple, which is understandable given this is technically a remaster of a PS2 game. Other than that, it is a top notch experience which merely drags on for too long. The music is spectacular, and the art is some of the best I've seen in gaming lately. I'll eventually get to playing the other entries... some day. <br><br>
	Play it for the:
	</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>Spectacular and catchy music</li>
	    <li>Beautiful artwork, and animated cutscenes</li>
	    <li>Social simulation</li>
	</ul>
