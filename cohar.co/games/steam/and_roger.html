        <p><i>and Roger</i> is a brief but impactful narrative experience that explores the fragmented nature of mental illness through minimalist visuals and deliberate pacing. The game uses simple yet evocative art direction to convey the disorientation and isolation of living with psychological distress. Its strength lies in its willingness to make the player uncomfortable - not through cheap scares, but through the unsettling feeling of losing grip on reality. The story unfolds in short, cohesive chapters that each contribute to a larger picture of someone struggling to maintain normalcy. While the gameplay is relatively straightforward and may feel limited to some players, the artistic choices and emotional honesty make it worth experiencing. It doesn't overstay its welcome, delivering its message in a focused, purposeful way that respects the player's time.<br><br>
