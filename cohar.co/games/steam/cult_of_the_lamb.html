	    <p>In a gaming landscape that's full of roguelites, and roguelikes, <i>Cult of the Lamb</i> is a little bit different. It combines classic - and very polished - roguelite gameplay with colony builder and farm simulator elements. These elements were tedious to me, but I can see them appealing to a different player - either way I can appreciate the dichotomy between the two core gameplay loops. <i>Cult of the Lamb</i> truly shines in its stylistic approach. The whole game is a jarring dichotomy between the demonic and miserable, and cuddly and adorable. I found myself unable to put it down due to how polished and stylistically convicted it was - even despite some tiring essential mechanics.<br><br>
