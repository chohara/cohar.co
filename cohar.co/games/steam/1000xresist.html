	    <p>This was the first game that was played in a "gaming book club" that I started with some college friends. We had all heard great things, so it was an easy first choice - I dove in without doing any research. <i>1000xRESIST</i> is a walking-sim, and that's okay. The game forgoes entertaining gameplay in favor of a very thought-provoking and philosophical narrative. It touches on a number of themes, ranging from marriage, to generational trauma, immigration, and so much in between. The world is very interesting and curious - it is deserving of the praise it has garnered in that respect. The soundtrack is solid, and very much acts as an accompaniment to the story. I can only recommend this to someone who can appreciate narrative driven experiences, but for that style it is excellent.<br><br>
	Play it for the:
