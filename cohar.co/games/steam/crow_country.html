	    <p><i>Crow Country</i> represents a tribute to the early PlayStation entries in the <i>Resident Evil</i> and <i>Silent Hill</i> series. As is the case with most indie games, <i>Crow Country</i> offers a very cohesive mesh of gameplay elements. In this case, the puzzles, combat, and map traversal are all well done and seemless. The story is a supernatural thriller, and came with a number of eery twists. I found that combat was a bit to unrewarding, and incentivized ignoring it altogether. The puzzles were mostly well made, with some exceptions. All in all, <i>Crow Country</i> knows what it is trying to be, and succeeds - I just find myself a bit exhausted of the genre. <br><br>
