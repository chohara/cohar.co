        <p><i>Hauntii</i> is this month's Joystick Junkies pick, and one that I chose myself after hearing about it through some publication at the end of last year. It's a beautiful art style wrapping a standard twin-stick shooter - under the radar but absolutely worth discovering. The story is simple and abstract, yet undeniably cute. The gameplay doesn't develop much beyond its initial premise, content to let the stunning artwork do the talking. There's something reminiscent of a cozy game here due to the emphasis on the "vibe" - each world unfolds with its own distinct theme and hue, creating an atmosphere that's easy to get lost in. Ultimately, <i>Hauntii</i> is an eye-catching twin-stick shooter with shallow but enjoyable gameplay that prioritizes visual artistry over mechanical depth.<br><br>
