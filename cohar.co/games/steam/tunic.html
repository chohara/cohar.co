	    <p><i>Tunic</i> was another pick from my monthly gaming bookclub - I had heard very little about the game, other than some general praise from friends. You take control of a fox who awakens on an island that is wrapped in mystery. The gameplay draws inspiration from a number of genres, but is perhaps most similar to a classic <i>Zelda</i> adventure. <i>Tunic</i> is packed with charm, mystery and just enough difficulty. A key element of the game is the accompanying instruction manual, which is in a seemingly foreign language. As your journey continues, you acquire more pages for this manual, which begins to provide details about the world around you and the story that preceded it. Dedicated players will want to uncover all of the secrets of the manual in order to follow the "Golden Path". Accompanying this whimsical and mysterious journey is a fantastic soundtrack of electronic music. I don't want to spoil too much detail, for this is one of those rare games that is best experienced totally blind, but trust that it will be worth it.<br><br>
