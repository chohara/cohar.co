	    <p><i>Grunn</i> was this months pick for my gaming "book club". Disguised as a gardening simulator, <i>Grunn</i> is a loop-based puzzle game that plays similarly to <i>Outer Wilds</i> - a genre that some are calling "wildslike". The core gameplay finds you solving small puzzles described by polaroid pictures that you find throughout a mystical little Dutch town. As you solve puzzles, you collect items that progress you in the world, occasionally unlocking story beats. Not every puzzle is required to get the true ending, and they range in difficulty. The primary objective is somewhat obvious, but little is provided in terms of compelling motivation to accomplish that objective. I found myself more drawn to more compelling side puzzles, namely the band and their lost instruments. The game also incorporates money as a form of resource - a feature that I found irritating as it tasked you with an egg hunt each loop. In total, <i>Grunn</i> provides some fun, satisfying moments, along with a little annoyance. Give it a try if you like games such as <i>Blue Prince</i> or <i>Outer Wilds</i><br><br>
