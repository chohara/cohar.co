	    <p>This month in my gaming "bookclub" there was an optional sidequest game, given that we had a longer-than-usual break between meetings. That game - <i>Furi</i> - was already on my backlog, so I figured why not give it a go! It was a quick play, and featured two highlights for me: the art/character design, and the soundtrack. These two elements were superb, and complimented one another very well. The gameplay is somewhat derivative, playing like a hybrid bullethell and soulslike. The story is esoteric, and features some kinda long "cutscenes" where you walk and talk about what's happening. The game focuses solely on boss fights for the actual gameplay, and the quality of these fights vary greatly. Some are boring and easy, some are tedious, while some are good fun - it's very much a mixed bag. It's worth giving a try if you're a fan of bullethell style games, or specifically <i>Hades</i>, as there is some mechanical similarity. <br><br>
