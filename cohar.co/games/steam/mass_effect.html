        <p>As this month's Joystick Junkies game, I finally tackled Bioware's <i>Mass Effect</i> - a title that's been sitting on my backlog for what feels like forever. This foundational space opera definitely shows its age in places, from the occasionally clunky UI to some dated mission design, but it's easy to see why it became such an iconic series. The game's strength lies in its characterization and world-building, introducing you to a vast universe filled with lore and memorable personalities. Commander Shepard's journey across the galaxy feels genuinely epic, even when the dialogue veers into campy territory. What surprised me most was how much I enjoyed the combat - the biotic powers in particular add a satisfying tactical layer that kept encounters engaging throughout. It's the kind of game where you can feel the ambition radiating from every corner, establishing a blueprint that would influence countless RPGs to come.<br><br>
