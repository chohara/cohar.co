	    <p><i>Rivals of Aether II</i> is basically a love letter to the competitive <i>Super Smash Bros.</i> fandom. The game features a small but incredibly deep cast of characters, and is defined by its mechanics and learning curve. I can't recommend this game to a newcomer, although I have no doubt that a newcomer would have fun playing - so long as they play opponents of a similar level. This is because the online experience is so punishing, and at times toxic. The gameplay is great, and reminiscent of <i>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i> or the mod <i>Project M</i>. As a fan of the platform fighter genre, <i>Rivals of Aether II</i> is awesome, and a game I've been having a lot of fun playing. The developers seem passionate, and there has been a good flow of content thus far. Hopefully the success continues - I'm curious to see what Offbrand Games can do next.<br><br>
