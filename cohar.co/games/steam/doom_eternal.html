	    <p>I've long been a fan of first-person shooter games - harkening back to <i>Halo</i> and <i>Team Fortress 2</i>, so it wasn't a question of if I'd enjoy <i>DOOM Eternal</i>, but rather how much. I played <i>DOOM</i> (2016) before the inception of cohar.co, so I am no stranger to the reboot of this iconic series. While the gameplay isn't transformative in the same way that the original <i>DOOM</i> was, <i>Eternal</i> offers a buttery-smooth shooter experience that expands on its predecessor without taking unnecessary risk. The story follows the iconic DOOMHUNTER, who seeks to save Earth by defeating the source of ardent energy that is spawning demons. It's all very over the top, but in a unique way - compare it to the Warhammer 40K story. The gameplay is a high-paced blast, with some good challenge. I particularly enjoyed the Slayer Gates, which I found featured some of the best level design. <i>DOOM Eternal</i> is at it's best when you're bouncing around, blasting enemies, and at it's worst when you're fighting against the environment, hitting into obstacles. The game is very well polished, and feels like a well-oiled machine except in rare circumstances. This legendary series just continues to deliver, time and time again. <br><br>
