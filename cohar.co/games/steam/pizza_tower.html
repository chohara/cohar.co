	    <p>I played this game as a part of a gaming discussion group, and had the opporunity to talk a bit about that game following completion. <i>Pizza Tower</i> plays like a mixture between <i>Sonic</i> and <i>Warioland</i>, tasking the player with traversing a map forwards, and then in reverse. Controlling Peppino - the main character - feels intuitive, but there are some annoyances. Level design varied heavily, with some maps being memorable and fun, and others irritating and forgettable. My favorite maps were undoubtedly the boss fights, which I found to be a good, fun challenge. The art style is cartoonish, and very deliberate in it's approach - you either love it or you hate it. The accompanying soundtrack was good overall, although a couple songs were grating. All things considered, <i>Pizza Tower</i> is a solid platforming experience, that features a highly distinct, and divisive, style. <br><br>
