        <p><i>Birth</i> is a short, quirky point-and-click experience that leans heavily into abstract and surreal aesthetics. The game's melancholic tone is amplified by its classical music accompaniment, creating an atmosphere that's simultaneously relaxing and unsettling. Visually, it's artistic in a way that prioritizes mood over clarity, which works both for and against it - the environments are memorable, but the puzzles can feel unintuitive as a result. The cast of characters is odd but somewhat charming in their strangeness, each contributing to the dreamlike quality of the experience. It's the kind of game you play in one sitting, letting the simple interactions and ambient soundscape wash over you. While it won't challenge you mechanically or overstay its welcome, <i>birth</i> offers a brief escape into something deliberately weird and contemplative.<br><br>
