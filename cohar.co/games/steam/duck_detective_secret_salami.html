	    <p>I'm a sucker for a short game every once-in-a-while, especially since it feels like most games these days try to pad out their runtime in order to compete in the market. <i>Duck Detective: The Secret Salami</i> is a bite-sized point-and-click adventure that has you play as a Duck who is called in to a bus station to solve a mystery. With a runtime of ~2 hours, it is very easy to complete <i>Duck Detective</i> in a single sitting. The puzzles in the game task you with connecting different pieces of evidence in order to make progress. I found the puzzles well-designed, although at times too easy to solve by brute-force. The game is defined by an eclectic cast and a fair bit of humor. I look forward to trying the next entry in the series! <br><br>
