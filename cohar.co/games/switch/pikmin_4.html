	    <p>I first started <i>Pikmin 4</i> shortly after it was released, but I put it down for a reason that I can't remember. I recently picked it back up, and had a good time finising the main objective. Pikmin 4 introduces many new mechanics, most of which are welcome additions. In general, it seems that the additions and changes serve to make the game more accessible. After the credits roll the player is presented with an extension of the story, bringing with it more levels, challenges, and some familiar faces. While it may be easier than previous entries, I didn't mind - it made for a more tranquil experience. Ultimately, <i>Pikmin 4</i> is a worthwhile entry in the series for fans new and old.<br><br>
