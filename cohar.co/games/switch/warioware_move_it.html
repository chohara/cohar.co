	<p>The WarioWare series is all about short, sweet mini-games without much else - and Move It! is no different. The "microgames" this time around are a lot of fun, with an emphasis on the motion tracking feature of the Joy-Con. While the amount of content is limited from a single player perspective, Move It! would offer a great multiplayer experience, and is something I look forward to bringing out with guests.<br><br>
