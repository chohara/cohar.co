	    <p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is a game where you actually play as Zelda, for once. The basic premise is that you have a staff that can create copies of certain objects you have seen and "captured". This provides for some fun puzzles and combat, although I often found myself reusing the same superior objects. The story is interesting, and has deeper lore than we usually get in a Legend of Zelda game, which is funny. The art is very cute, and reminiscent of the Link's Awakening remake for the Switch.<br><br>
	    Play it for the:

		<ul>
			<li>Surprisingly deep lore</li>
			<li>Unique core mechanic</li>
			<li>Actually Zelda this time</li>	
		</ul>
