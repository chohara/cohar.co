	    <p>As a disclaimer, my first time finishing Metroid Prime was with this remaster. That being said, Metroid Prime Remastered is a well polished remake that makes the game more accessible on modern hardware. Metroid Prime is an all time classic game that combines first-person alien shooting gameplay, in the eponymous Metroidvania style. The remaster adds some quality of life fixes, while providing the option to play closer to the original experience. There's not much more to say, it's excellence top-to-bottom!<br><br>
