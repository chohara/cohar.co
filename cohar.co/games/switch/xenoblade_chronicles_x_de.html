	    <p>I was always conflicted about <i>Xenoblade Chronicles X</i> (<i>XCX</i>). The setting and aesthetic are up my alley, but it is notorious for it's long runtime (it takes dozens of hours to unlock your first mech!). With the launch of the <i>Definitive Edition</i> and a brief lull before the release of the <i>Switch 2</i> I figured I'd finally give it a try. While I had always imagined the game would play like a JRPG, <i>XCX</i> actually plays more akin to an MMORPG, without the MMO elements. The game tasks you with assisting various people and factions as you attempt to find the </i>Lifehold</i> Core, in order to save humanity. The questlines vary greatly in tone and quality, making for some fun juxtaposition. There are so many different game systems to interact with, and for the sake of my initial playthrough I barely scratched the surface. The combat system is deep with a high degree of customizability. The game is not without it's flaws - the progression is slow and grinding at times, balance can be questionable, and the main narrative is quite scattered. All of this is particularly relevant in the early-game, and for me almost all was forgotten once the first "skell" came online. The satisfaction of mowing down some enemies with a giant robot is a peak gaming experience - and honestly enhanced by the fact that you have to play for a while to unlock it. The path of progression is gradual, but to me there was always an adequate payoff. With all that in consideration, I had a lot of fun making my way through <i>XCX</i> over the course of 90 hours(!) and I think it offers something very unique in the gaming landscape. Give this one a try, but play it with an open mind. <br><br>
