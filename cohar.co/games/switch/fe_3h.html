	    <p>As a fan of the series since the GBA, I love the core gameplay, and unique and varied characters. Three Houses made some leaps with the series, namely the introduction of the <i>somniel</i> which introduces a visual novel style school, where you interact with your units in third person. The core gameplay is still brilliant, but the newly added mechanics detract from time spent as a tactical SRPG general - where the series blooms, in my opinion. Regardless, Three Houses offers well balanced combat, and perhaps the best story in the series, making it a great game overall.  <br><br>
