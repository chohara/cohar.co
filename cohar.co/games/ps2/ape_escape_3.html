        <p>This month's Joystick Junkies selection brought me to <i>Ape Escape 3</i>, a series I'd never touched before. What I found was a quirky, undeniably unique platformer that doesn't quite nail the fundamentals but compensates with charm and personality. The controls feel janky at times - the gadget-based gameplay demands more precision than the camera and movement allow - but there's something endearing about chasing down funny monkeys across increasingly absurd scenarios. What caught me off guard was the soundtrack, which carries a surprisingly mature, almost melancholic tone that elevates the otherwise lighthearted chaos. The game leans heavily into movie references and pop culture parody, giving each level a distinct flavor even when the core gameplay grows repetitive. It's far from polished, but <i>Ape Escape 3</i> has enough quirky characteristics to make it memorable.<br><br>
