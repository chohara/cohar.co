	    <p><i>WarioWare Gold</i> is much like the other titles in the series, but with extra polish. In a lot of ways, <i>Gold</i> feels like the culmination of handheld <i>WarioWare</i> - combining the old with the new. It adds some additional modes, which provide a lot of new ways to play, even an online mode! While it doesn't reinvent the formula and remains quite short, <i>WarioWare Gold</i> feels like a more worthwhile investment than the previous handheld installments in the series. I found the final stage in particular to be a lot fun, mixing a variety of minigame types and providing a greater challenge than usual. Some of the <i>Touched</i> minigames really brought back some memories, and that token <i>WarioWare</i> weirdness is availble in droves - I'm glad to have played it!<br><br>
