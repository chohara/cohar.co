	    <p>This entry in the <i>Fire Emblem</i> series is a reimagining of one of the earlier Famicom titles that never saw an English localization. It plays traditionally, with the addition of third-person exploration sections - which are quite fun. The characters are interesting, although a bit samey, and the story is adequate, but not fantastic. The soundtrack is great, as is the case with most <i>Fire Emblem</i> titles, and really helps carry the presentation. The map design, particularly early on, is a headache - a problem that is alleviated as your units become more mobile. <i>Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia</i> is a game that accomplishes what it needs to. I hope that we see more Japanese exlclusive entries brought global in a similar way.<br><br>
