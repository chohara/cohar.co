	    <p><i>Kid Icarus: Uprising</i> represents the first entry in the <i>Kid Icarus</i> series since 1991, and acts as a tech demo for the 3DS, in a lot of ways. Directed by Masahiro Sakurai, you play as Pit in a journey that spans heaven, hell, and space. With gameplay that resembles <i>Star Fox</i> - a rail shooter - <i>Kid Icarus: Uprising</i> is a ultimately a lot of fun, and shines in multiple ways as a game. The characters are memorable, the dialogue is funny, and the gameplay addicting, although straining on the hands. This game is a hidden gem on the system, and I hope we see more of Pit, Palutena, and the rest of the cast soon.<br><br>
	Play it for the:
	</p>
