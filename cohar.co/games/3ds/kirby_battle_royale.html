	    <p><i>Kirby Battle Royale</i> isn't an actual game in the battle royale genre - it instead plays as a series of minigames intended for four player multiplayer. For the sake of this review, I only completed the story mode without really doing multiplayer - since I'm not friends with any losers who play mediocre old Kirby games. <i>Kirby Battle Royale</i> is ultimately a disappointment, with barely enough charm to make it palatable. With there only being ten different minigames, I found myself bored with nearly all of them by the end of the short story mode. With that considered, I don't doubt that <i>Kirby Battle Royale</i> would be a lot more fun with friends.<br><br>
