	    <p><i>Fire Emblem: Awakening</i> sought to breathe new life into the series after a brief period of hibernation and disinvestment. To me, it accomplished that, and offers a modern tactical strategy experience, with all the endowments for which <i>Fire Emblem</i> is revered. The troupe of characters is diverse and ecletic, and their interactions are fun to see. The core gameplay is some of the best in the series, in my opinion, and minimizes some of the frustrations that afflicted earlier titles. The soundtrack and story is good, not great - although the lattered is centered around a somewhat hollow player character. <i>Awakening</i> is a great entry in the <i>Fire Emblem</i> series, and a game I would recommend as a perfect entry point for a newcomer to the series. <br><br>
