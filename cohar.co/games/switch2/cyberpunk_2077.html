	    <p>I have a long history with <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>, dating back to the long hype cycle and disappointing launch. I quit the game quite quickly after release as it was an unfinished mess, and swore not to play it again. That lasted a couple of years until some friends and creators recommended the game, swearing that it was in a better state. I caved and gave it another try - and while it was definitely improved, I found myself dropping the game again for no reason in particular. I wasn't planning on giving it another try, but I ended up receiving the Switch 2 port as a gift from my Mom. With that, and the sparse selection of Switch 2 games on launch, I found myself trying <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> one final time. Perhaps it was the <i>Phantom Liberty</i> expansion, or maybe it was the novelty of playing it on the Switch 2, but this time I finally made it through - and quite enjoyed it! First, it's worth noting that this particular port of the game is quite good. I experienced a couple of crashes, and a few instances of notable frame rate drops, but overall gameplay was smooth. The portable performance is quite impressive, although battery life is a limitation. The plot is okay, with some interesting decision points in which you "decide" your character's moral compass. The <i>Phantom Liberty</i> content is great, and really feels like a less cliche neo-noire cyberpunk tale with some great betrayal and intrigue. The combat is a lot of fun, if not a little too easy at times. I found myself going bare-knuckles most of the time for an added challenge, and it was still a breeze. Granted, I didn't mess around with difficulty settings, I like that in a Bethesda-like RPG - yes, I'm calling it that. Take it from someone who really doesn't want to admit it: <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> is a good game that's worth your time, and this port delivers.<br><br>
