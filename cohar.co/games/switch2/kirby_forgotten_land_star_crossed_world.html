	    <p>I had a great time with <i>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</i> when it originally launched, so I was excited to revisit it with the <i>Star Crossed World</i> upgrades. On top of the standard <i>Switch 2</i> suite of changes (60FPS, etc) <i>Star Crossed World</i> offers 12 total additional levels and a few new <i>Mouthful Modes</i>. These new levels are awesome, and recapture the essence that made <i>Forgotten Land</i> so great - tasking you with finding collectables and secrets as usual. The new <i>Mouthful Modes</i> are great, with the gear and sign-sled being my favorites. In addition to the added levels, <i>Star Crossed World</i> introduces a new cup in the colosseum, providing some post-game challenge. This new content is a great continuation of an already great game, use it as an excuse to play this stellar <i>Kirby</i> title one more time.<br><br>
	    Play it for the:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Continuation of a magnificent <i>Kirby</i> game</li>
			<li>Challenging new colosseum content</li>
			<li>Starry and whimsical new levels and characters</li>	
		</ul>
