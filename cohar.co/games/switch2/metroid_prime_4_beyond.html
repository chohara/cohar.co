        <p>After years of waiting, <i>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</i> revives the series with both reverence and ambition. This is still classic <i>Metroid Prime</i> at its core - first-person exploration through beautiful alien environments with an ominous ambient soundtrack setting the tone. The visuals are stunning, particularly in standout moments like the ice lab that gradually melts as you restore power, creating a dynamic, evolving space. New additions like the controversial companion characters and motorbike roaming segments shake up the formula, though opinions will vary on their execution. The game is rather linear compared to earlier entries, but each environment feels meticulously crafted, capped off by dramatic boss battles that serve as memorable highlights. Each of the environments - and the boss that caps them off - are great, making the journey satisfying even if it doesn't reach the heights of the original trilogy. It's worth the time for anyone who's been waiting for Samus to return.<br><br>
