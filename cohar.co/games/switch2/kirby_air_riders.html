        <p>Having played the original <i>Kirby Air Ride</i>, I went into <i>Kirby Air Riders</i> with high expectations, particularly excited for City Trial's return and the addicting checklist system. I'm thrilled to report it lives up to those expectations and then some. This is a love letter to <i>Kirby</i> fans, repackaging the original gameplay perfectly while adding fun new additions that make it feel more complete. The crazy new vehicles expand the roster in creative ways, and the online replayability ensures you'll keep coming back long after you've seen everything once. The story mode is admittedly simple and basic, but it's also lowkey epic in a way only <i>Kirby</i> can pull off, serving as a culmination of characters from across the series. This new stage - Nova - is a favorite of mine, perfectly capturing what makes the game special. While it may seem straightforward on the surface, the depth comes from mastering each vehicle and chasing those checklist unlocks.<br><br>
