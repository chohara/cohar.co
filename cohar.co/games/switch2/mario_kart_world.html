	    <p>Like a whirlwind the Switch 2 has come and launched, and with it a new entry in the beloved <i>Mario Kart</i> franchise!<i>Mario Kart World</i> seeks to be the biggest experience in the series to date, and looks to be Nintendo's answer to the live-service revolution. While a bit sparse at launch, <i>World</i> has all the foundation of a huge expanding experience, capstoned by the free-roam mode. While I've seen some complaints about the free-roam mode, and the lack of content therein, I have been having a lot of fun with it. The challenge buttons are a joy to find and complete, and the other collectables have been a nice treat while touring the different racetracks and roadways. On top of this, it is very clear where there is room to grow - and I have no doubts that Nintendo will iterate as time goes on. As far as mechanics and racing gameplay, <i>World</i> is easily some of the best, and most fun I've had. There seems to be a depth of mechanics beyond what was available in <i>Mario Kart 8</i>, while not making these mechanics overcentralizing. It is still early on, and there is much room to grow, but I have confidence that <i>World</i> will deliver. In the meantime, it is the latest entry in one of the great multiplayer gaming experiences - what more can you ask for!<br><br>
