        <p>I typically wouldn't be excited for a <i>Mario Tennis</i> game, but at this early point in the Switch 2 lifecycle I'm hyped for anything novel. My last game in the series was <i>Mario Tennis Aces</i> which I played - and disliked - close to its release. I found it to be very lacking in content, and ultimately very simple. <i>Mario Tennis Fever</i> looked to be more promising, with a more robust offering of single-player content. In practice, <i>Fever</i> offers a genuinely enjoyable sports game with a nice blend of cartoon-fun, and competitive strategy. There are a fair number of game modes to choose from, each of varying degrees of fun and replayability. I found the Special Stages and Ring Shot games to be great fun, while the Piranha Plant challenge was a slog. The highlight for me was the Adventure mode, which was short, goofy, and pretty varied in terms of gameplay. The trials also open up the game, with the goal of 3-starring all 100 trials offering hours of additional playtime. Ultimately, <i>Mario Tennis Fever</i> is a short and simple game, but with a refreshing amount of replayability - both in terms of multiplayer fun, and single-player content.<br><br>
        Play it for the:

            <li>Various fever rackets and special moves</li>
            <li>Short and goofy Adventure mode</li>
