	    <p><i>Riviera: The Promised Land</i> is a niche game that blends JRPG, visual novel, and point-and-click elements into something that feels entirely its own. The mix of genres could have been a mess, but instead it comes together as a fun curiosity with surprisingly enjoyable combat. The battle system features deep strategy centered around weapon durability management - every item has limited uses, forcing you to think carefully about when to deploy your best equipment. The adequate story is elevated by quirky splash art that gives each character personality, and the soundtrack delivers some memorable songs that stick with you. The final boss gauntlet is particularly satisfying, testing everything you've learned throughout the game. Finally, the game features multiple endings depending on your earlier choices. <i>Riviera</i> doesn't revolutionize any of the genres it borrows from, but it carves out its own unique space on the GBA library worth exploring.<br><br>
