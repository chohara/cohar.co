	    <p>There are few games that can claim to have mastered a genre, and to me <i>Yoshi's Island</i> can make that claim. From start to finish, <i>Yoshi's Island</i> delivers charm, fun, and memorable moments. Each level is unique, and seems thoughtfully created. We're introduced to a number of new characters, each with a beautiful sprite and some defining sound effects. Don't get me started on the soundtrack, which is one of my favorite in all of gaming. <i>Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3</i> is a GBA port of the original SNES game, and maintains every bit of the originals beauty. The GBA soundcard muffles the soundtrack slightly, but not enough to tarnish it. Everyone deserves to give this one a try - it can appeal to all ages, and is truly the pinnacle of 2D platformers.<br><br>
