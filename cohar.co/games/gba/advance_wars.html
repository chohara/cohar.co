	    <p><i>Advance Wars</i> is a turn-based tactical strategy that was released early in the GBA lifecycle on September 10th, 2001. The game shares some similar gameplay with <i>Fire Emblem</i>, given that they were both developed by Intelligent Systems. Upon discovering this, I was excited to finally give <i>Advance Wars</i> a try. What followed was a solid handheld experience with some rough edges. In a lot of ways, <i>Advance Wars</i> feels like a precursor game - there are plenty of grating gampeplay elements, difficulty jumps, and even some softlocks. With that in mind it still delivers <b>many</b> hours of rewarding tactical gameplay, but the area for improvement is sometimes too hard to ignore. Maybe it has aged poorly, or maybe <i>Advance Wars 2</i> resolves a lot of the blatant issues - I'll have to play it sometime and find out.<br><br>
