        <p><i>Metal Slug Advance</i> delivers exactly what you'd expect from the series in portable form - classic 2D side-scrolling action with tight controls and nostalgic charm. The gameplay is simple but consistently fun, capturing that arcade energy even on the GBA's smaller screen. While it's undeniably somewhat shallow compared to more robust handheld offerings, the replayability comes from chasing difficult collectables and mastering the platforming challenges scattered throughout each level. The portability factor can't be understated - having <i>Metal Slug</i> on the go feels right, especially when showing it off on a Famicom Game Boy Micro. It's not trying to reinvent the wheel, just deliver a solid, portable slice of run-and-gun action that respects the series' legacy while embracing the handheld format.<br><br>
