	    <p>The <i>WarioWare</i> series is characterized by the presence of "microgames", which are extremely short minigames - merely three or so seconds each. <i>WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$!</i> - yes, that is the official title - is the first entry in the series. Given that it was limited to GBA hardware, <i>Mega Microgame$!</i> is exceptionally simple and never becomes particularly challenging. It succeeds stylistically, and sets the tone for the series to come. The characters, setting and sound are all quirky - which I find endearing. <i>WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$!</i> is a solid introduction to the series, but it has not aged gracefully.<br><br>
