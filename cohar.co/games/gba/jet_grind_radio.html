	    <p>Game Boy Advance is probably my favorite console to collect for, partly because there are so many odd games that were ported there. <i>Jet Grind Radio</i> is one such example, being a port of the Dreamcast game. The game is in an isometric perspective, and was developed with the same engine as the GBA ports of <i>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</i>. I was pretty apprehensive about how the game would control, but I ended up being pleasantly surprised. It is quite easy to control and navigate, spare for some specific instances where perceiving depth is important. The story is very similar to the 3D game, but it is told through splash art and text. Difficulty progression is excellent, as levels start very easy and gradually ramp up in toughness. The last couple levels had me retrying to nail the fastest line I could. The sound is solid for the GBA, but doesn't quite deliver on the audio experience that the series is known for. There is a bit of replayability, customization, and even a multiplayer mode to go along with the story. I was surprised with how much I enjoyed <i>Jet Grind Radio</i>, which presents a <i>very</i> comparable experience with it's console counterparts.<br><br>
