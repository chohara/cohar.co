        <p><i>Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow</i> is my second foray into the <i>Castlevania</i> series, following <i>Symphony of the Night</i>. The Soul system is the star here, encouraging you to explore every corner of Dracula's castle and slay monsters repeatedly to collect their abilities. This mechanic transforms what could be tedious grinding into an unexpectedly rewarding loop - each new soul feels like a genuine discovery. The difficulty hits a sweet spot thanks to the leveling system, keeping things challenging without becoming frustrating. The castle is packed with an excellent trove of enemies and bosses, with the fight against Death being a particular standout that required a few attempts to overcome. A killer soundtrack accompanies your journey throughout, with <i>Forbidden Area</i> being a track that still lingers in my head. The story is middling and has its moments, but the exceptional sprite-work more than compensates - the animations are expressive and full of character. With a fun assortment of weapons and abilities to experiment with, <i>Aria of Sorrow</i> is a classic metroidvania and a must-play on the Game Boy Advance.<br><br>
