	    <p><i>Iridion 3D</i> was a launch title for the Game Boy Advance, meant to showcase the power of the device. In all honesty, I only felt obligated to play this game because the sequel - <i>Iridion II</i> - has a good reputation, and I plan on playing it. <i>Iridion 3D</i> definitely succeeds in showing off the visual capabilities of the GBA, as you fly a ship through a makeshift 3D space (it plays like a rail shooter). The gameplay is fun at it's core, but is quite frustrating due to problems deciphering depth. The bosses were easily a highlight for me, with fun patterns and intense tunes. I look forward to giving the sequel a try - this one was fun, but definitely has its flaws.<br><br>
