	    <p><i>Metroid: Zero Mission</i> is a remake of the original NES <i>Metroid</i>, but with additional content. The remake is well done, and polishes the original metroidvania pioneer in a welcome way. The controls are fluid, and map traversal is smooth, especially as you become more powerful. The additional content lets you play as Zero Samus Suit, who is far more fragile than suited Samus. This leads to stealth-esque gameplay, culminating in a massive power up that makes you feel like Superman. This sequence was awesome, and really elevated the entire game for me. I'd recommend trying this for the final section alone, not to mention the pioneering remake underneath.<br><br>
