	    <p><i>Kirby: Nightmare in Dreamland</i> is a fine entry into the <i>Kirby</i> series, but not much more. The sprites are absolutely beautiful, and the levels are cute and delightful. While the platforming is crisp, it is rather simple and the game is exceptionally short in length. <i>Nightmare in Dreamland</i> is a ultimately an enjoyable experience, but it feels like it's missing something, in more than a few ways - that being said it's such a quick play that I can't help but recommend it.<br><br>
