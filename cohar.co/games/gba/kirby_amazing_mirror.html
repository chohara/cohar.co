	    <p><i>Kirby &amp; the Amazing Mirror</i> is a different kind of Kirby game, ressembling a metroidvania more than a conventional 2D platformer. You traverse a maze of different doors and worlds, fighting bosses and trying to find pieces of the fractured <i>Amazing Mirror</i>. The difficulty is spot on, the charm is immaculate, and the sprites and animations are some of the best ever. <i>Kirby &amp; the Amazing Mirror</i> is a masterclass in the metroidvania genre, while remaining as cute and cuddly as Kirby ever is. I could write about it for an hour, but the last thing I need to mention is the soundtrack. Each world with it's own music, traversing the world often leads to drastic shifts in music that might spark a number of different reactions, depending on the situation. This is a game that needs to be experienced to be truly appreciated, and thankfully it can be played anywhere, and on virtually anything, being a GBA game.  <br><br>
