	    <p>I had never heard of <i>Jazz Jackrabbit</i> until I walked into Pink Gorilla Games in Seattle. Part of the reason that I love the GBA is for it's broad array of games, which vary drastically in quality and identity. I had to buy <i>Jazz Jackrabbit</i> just so that I could see what it was all about. What I found, was a goofy and offbeat 2D platformer that follows Jazz Jackrabbit - a freakishly suave rabbit. The gameplay is basic, and reminscent of <i>Earthworm Jim</i> with simple lateral movement and shooting. There are multiple different guns that you unlock throughout the game, each with certain advantages and disadvantages. The story is intentionally generic, and they break the fourth wall to reference it, making for some genuine laughs. The story is conveyed through interstitial artwork, which is crudely drawn at times, but nevertheless fun. You really get a feeling that the developers at Game Titan had a fun time making <i>Jazz Jackrabbit</i>. <br><br>
