	    <p>As a disclaimer, I am far from a pinball wizard. Despite that, I played <i>The Pinball of the Dead</i> enough to get a good idea of what it offers - and I was impressed! There are three primary pinball tables to play with, and each offers different challenges, environments, and mini-games. Each table also features animated enemies that roam around, and die upon being hit. Players can also trigger boss fights, which are mechanically simple but somehow still pretty exciting. Through all of this, virtually everything is a reference to <i>The House of the Dead</i> and it's successors - including voicelines, hit splatters, and key characters. I did well enough to fight most of the bosses, achieved a score good for 4th on the leaderboard, and had more fun than I usually do playing pinball! <br><br>
