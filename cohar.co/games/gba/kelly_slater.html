	    <p><i>Kelly Slater's Pro Surfer</i> is a game that was released for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and also GBA for some reason. The 3D games are solid, and there is a cult fondness for them to this day. The GBA game, on the other hand, is in 2D and leaves a lot to be desired. Basically, you enter directional combos in order to perform tricks off a wave. The waves look quite nice as they roll, but thats about as much as <i>Kelly Slater</i> can offer on the GBA. I found the controls unintuitive, and practicing didn't yield results. What did work was spamming the same high scoring trick ad nauseum. I didn't play much of this one, and I wouldn't advise you to either.<br><br>
