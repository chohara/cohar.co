        <p>After playing <i>Iridion 3D</i> last year, I was eager to see if the sequel could deliver on its reputation - and it does. <i>Iridion II</i> trades the rail-shooter perspective for a traditional vertical shmup, and the result is a far more polished experience. Though I'm not deeply versed in the shoot 'em up genre, I've always appreciated its appeal, and this game makes a strong case for the GBA as a capable home for the classics. The stage artwork is fantastic, presenting a clear upgrade over its predecessor's already impressive visuals. Great sprites maintain generally good clarity even when the screen fills with chaos. Smooth controls and clear animations made it a breeze to play on the Game Boy Micro.
        The electronic soundtrack deserves special mention - with a jukebox mode that lets you sample sounds and full tracks, it's easily one of the best musical arrangements on the GBA. Bosses vary in difficulty but remain consistently fun to learn and conquer. Challenge and arcade modes add replayability for fans who want to test their skills. Unfortunately, the password save system is a major headache that limits this hidden GBA gem's ceiling. Still, <i>Iridion II</i> proves that Shin'en knew exactly how to push the hardware.<br><br>
