	    <p>At this point I'm starting to have an alarming amount of experience with pinball games. After getting thru <i>Pokemon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire</i> I figured I'd keep the ball rolling (heh) and try out another GBA pinball title - <i>Muppet Pinball Mayhem</i>! This game comes with three tables unlocked by default, and a fourth which is unlocked by clearing Adventure Mode. Each of the tables is based around a character from Jim Henson's <i>Muppets</i>, specifically Kermit, Miss Piggy, Gonzo, and Animal. The physics and general mechanics are quite forgiving here, leading to some pretty long "runs" - something that I appreciated. The quality varies from table to table, with the Miss Piggy table being considerably harder than the rest. The soundtrack is initially enjoyable with a classic <i>Muppets</i> overture, but it quickly becomes exhausting once you realize there are basically no other songs. Overall I had a fun time unlocking Animal's table, but I don't think that I'll be picking this one up again too soon.<br><br>
