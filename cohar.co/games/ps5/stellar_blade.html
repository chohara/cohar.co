	    <p><i>Stellar Blade</i> is a sci-fi soulslike that does a lot of great things, without reinventing the wheel. The game opens with what looks to be a K-Pop "idol", who falls from space and proceeds to fight zombies with a lightsaber. As-if compensating for the corniness, <i>Stellar Blade</i> delivers challenging, strategic, and action-packed gameplay that tests a broad range of skills. I found myself constantly engaged due to the varying mechanics, ranging from third-person shooting to some tough 3D platforming. Additionally, the presence of a number of collectables helps provide some incentive for exploration, with the soundtrack providing great accompaniment. The plot isn't revolutionary, but delivers an interesting story about transhumanism and futurism. The culmination of the game was heart-pumping, with a rush of challenging bosses. I also found the pacing to be great, with very little filler. Ultimately, <i>Stellar Blade</i> is a must play for the system, and presents a premium and polished experience.<br><br>
