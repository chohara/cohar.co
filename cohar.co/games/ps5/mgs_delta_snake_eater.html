	    <p>As a fan of the <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> series, and of the original <i>Snake Eater</i> in particular, I was naturally excited to try this remaster. The game remains the same with the exception of some quality of life changes - which are great, and also mostly optional. To begin, the player is presented wth a choice between two modes - New or Legacy. There are numerous cosmetic changes, and some optional additional content, but Konami did a great job of persisting what made the original <i>Snake Eater</i> so iconic. I spent my playthrough basking in the nostalgia of each level, while messing around with the timeless gimmicks and interactions. The story is weird but intriguing - different in a way that Kojima is now famous for. If you haven't given this classic a try, I highly recommend giving this version a try!<br><br>
