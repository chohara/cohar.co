	    <p><i>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</i> is an unexpected gem that quickly garnered a cult following. Released just a couple of months ago, in April 2025, <i>Expedition 33</i> adds to what has been an extraordinary year in gaming by delivering a memorable and inventive experience - one which deserves all the praise it has received. At it's core the game is a party-based JRPG, with a lot of classic elements that a fan of the genre would enjoy. It adds a real-time touch to this antique formula in the form of parries and dodges during enemy turns. This change, along with the unique character mechanics, made the combat enjoyable and rewarding - something that I can't say for the vast majority of JRPGs. The rest of the formula remains the same, however, and tiring exploration is what prevents this game from receiving a perfect rating. The story that wraps the gameplay is exquisite, with some of the most interesting narrative swings and plot points that I can recently remember.  And finally, the soundtrack; a diverse arrangement that swells with the narrative in a beautiful way. This a must play for JRPG fans, and can be easily enjoyed by fans of other genres as well.<br><br>
