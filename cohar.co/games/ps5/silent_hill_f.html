	    <p>This Halloween season there was no question what I was going to be playing, as <i>Silent Hill f</i> dropped late in September. I'm a fan of the series, with the original <i>Silent Hill 2</i> being one of my favorite gaming experiences - <i>f</i> looked good from the prerelease marketing so needless to say I was excited to play it immediately. The narrative and setting are different, taking place in rural Japan about 50 years ago. As such, there is a large focus on traditional themes in the mysterious and intriguing plot. But first, the combat; it plays like a simple 3rd person action game - think <i>Dark Souls</i> with training wheels. The plot is where the game really shines, with a confusing mystery that opens up at the end, enticing the player to start another playthrough immediately. <i>Silent Hill f</i> is filled with lore and notes that drive you to persist thru the horde of ghouls. Encounters are frightening at times, but at other times can be tedious and predictable. In my opinion, the horror elements were quite good, with many different styles represented well. This is a great entry in the series, and inspires hope that they can create great new things with the franchise. Play it for the story, twists, and horror - no spoilers!<br><br>
